<p>Carl’s Coal Mining operates in a remote area. Because of its location, it has monopsony power in the local labor market for miners. Its marginal revenue product of labor is
<span class="math display">\[MRP_L = 400-5L\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the total number of miners. The labor supply curve of local miners is
<span class="math display">\[w = 5L-50\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the wage (in $1000’s per miner).</p>
