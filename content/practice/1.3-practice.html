<p>You can get music via downloads (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) or concert tickets (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>). You have $60 to spend each week, and the price of a download is $3 and the price of a concert ticket is $10. Put <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> on the horizontal axis and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> on the vertical axis.</p>
<div id="section" class="section level1">
<h1>1</h1>
<p>Write the equation for your budget constraint.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-1" class="section level1">
<h1>2</h1>
<p>Solve this equation for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, to express the equation of the line.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-2" class="section level1">
<h1>3</h1>
<p>If you spent all of your money on only Downloads, how many could you buy? If you spent all of your money only on Tickets, how many could you buy? What is the slope of your budget constraint? Graph your budget constraint.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-3" class="section level1">
<h1>4</h1>
<p>Now suppose your income temporarily decreases to $30. Find the new equation of the budget constraint and graph it.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-4" class="section level1">
<h1>5</h1>
<p>Now return to your original income ($60) but suppose the price of downloads increases to $6. Find the new equation of the budget constraint and graph it.</p>
</div>
