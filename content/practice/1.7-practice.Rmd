The demand for monthly cell phone plans is given by:

$$q_D =  50-0.5p$$

## Question 1 
Write the *inverse* demand function.

## Question 2 
Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $10. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?

## Question 3
Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $70. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?

## Question 4
At what price is demand unit elastic $(\epsilon=-1)$?

## Question 5
Calculate the total revenue at $10.

## Question 6
Calculate the total revenue at $70.

## Question 7
Calculate the total revenue at the price you found for question 4.
