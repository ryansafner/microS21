The supply and demand in the market for tomatoes are estimated to be:
$$\begin{align*}
q_D&=1000-200p\\
q_S&=200p-200\\ \end{align*}$$

## 1. 
Calculate the market-clearing price and quantity exchanged.

## 2.
Find the inverse demand function and inverse supply function.

## 3.
Sketch a graph of this market, labelling key points.

## 4.
Calculate the price elasticty of demand and price elasticity of supply (in equilibrium).

## 5.
Calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus, and shade each on the graph.

## 6.
Who gets greater surplus, consumers or producers, and why?
