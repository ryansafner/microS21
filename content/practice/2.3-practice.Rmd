Your firm can use labor $l$ and capital $k$ to produce output according to the production function:
$$q=4lk$$


The marginal products are:

$$\begin{align*}
MP_l &=4k \\
MP_k &=4l \\ \end{align*}$$

Suppose you  need to produce 144 units, the price of labor is $10, and the price of capital is $40. 

## 1. 
What is the least-cost combination of labor and capital that produces 144 units of output?

## 2.
How much does this combination cost?

## 3.
Does this technology experience constant returns, increasing returns, or decreasing returns to scale?
