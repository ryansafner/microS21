## Exam 2

We are ready for Exam 2. However, this semester has an awkward schedule, for two reasons: first is Section 2 is a full week behind Section 1 due to Spring Break days, and second is that next week is “Wellness week” and I cannot give an exam during that week. Thus:

- For Section 1 (M/W)

We will proceed with 3.1 and 3.2 for the next two classes (Wed Mar 24 and Mon Mar 29) and have a review session on Wed Mar 31 for Exam 2. Topics 3.1 and 3.2 will *not* be on Exam 2, but will be on the Final Exam.

- For Section 2 (Tu/Th)

We will catch up and finish 2.6 on Tues Mar 30, and have a review session on Thur April 1.

**Both sections will have Exam 2 the week of April 5**.
