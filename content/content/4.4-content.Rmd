# <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we cover a topic that often does not get covered in microeconomics courses, but is important nonetheless for our purposes: markets for factors of production (e.g. land, labor, capital, supplies, etc). We discuss what determines prices in these markets, and how they vary with *monopoly* power and *monopsony* power (a buyer with market power). 

Today we focus on *labor* markets as the main factor market, and all of us are participants in labor markets. However, the analysis today can be applied to *any* market for an input to production. Next class, we will look at capital markets as another factor market.^[Section 2 (Tu/Th) will skip 4.5 on Capital Markets, since they have 1 fewer class meeting this semester.]

## Capital Markets

I had originally meant to make 4.5 Factor Markets II: Capital Markets, but for time I cut it out to only focus on labor markets. The slides I had made are below:
