<p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <strong>Note to Section 2 (TuTh)</strong>: Hood College <a href="https://www.hood.edu/offices-services/registrars-office/academic-calendar">has designated</a> Thursday February 18 to be one of the four days this semester where there are no classes. There will be no video to watch — we will have our next class meeting until Tuesday, February 23.</p>
<h2 id="overview"><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>Today we cover the third effect in the individual demand function: the (own) price effect, aka the <strong>law of demand</strong>: how changes in a good’s (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good.</p>
<p>We introduce the idea of (simplified, own-price) demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve. I will also show you examples of how we derive demand functions and curves.</p>
<p>The other major concept today is breaking apart the law of demand into two effects: the <strong>(real) income effect</strong>, and the <strong>substitution effect</strong>. We considering them conceptually and graphically. These can be a difficult concept for students to grasp.</p>

<li><a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Consumer/">Visualizing the Consumer’s Problem</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Consumer_changes/">Visualizing Changes in the Consumer’s Problem</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/Demand/">Visualizing Demand Shifters</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These are examples that I wrote in R/Shiny in the past, to visualize what it is we are looking at. As I find more time, I will update these and integrate them into our slides, but until then, I will just post links.</p>
<p>The first is a visual example of the static (one-time) Consumer’s problem. You can adjust things about the (Cobb-Douglas) utility function, income, and prices, and see how it would affect the graph and the optimum.</p>
<p>The second is a visual example of dynamic changes in the Consumer’s problem. The consumer starts at a pre-defined optimum. You can adjust any of the budget constraint parameters <span class="math inline">\((m, p_x, p_y)\)</span>, and see how it would affect a new optimum, which you can <em>compare</em> the the original optimum.</p>
<p>The third is a visual example of a hypothetical demand function for beer, with preference intensity, income, price of nachos (a complement), and price of wine (a substitute) as inputs to the function. Based on some pre-defined functions (in the background), you can change any of the inputs and see how it would affect the (inverse) demand function, expressed as a simple demand curve.</p>
<p>I hope some time to clean these up and make a few more, such as “Visualizing the Income and Substitution Effects” and “Estimating a Demand Function from Real World Data.”</p>
