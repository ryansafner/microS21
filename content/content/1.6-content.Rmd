<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> **Note to Section 2 (TuTh)**: Hood College [has designated](https://www.hood.edu/offices-services/registrars-office/academic-calendar) Thursday February 18 to be one of the four days this semester where there are no classes. There will be no video to watch — we will have our next class meeting until Tuesday, February 23.

# <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we cover the third effect in the individual demand function: the (own) price effect, aka the **law of demand**: how changes in a good's (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good. 

We introduce the idea of (simplified, own-price) demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve. I will also show you examples of how we derive demand functions and curves.

The other major concept today is breaking apart the law of demand into two effects: the **(real) income effect**, and the **substitution effect**. We considering them conceptually and graphically. These can be a difficult concept for students to grasp.
