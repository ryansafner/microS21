<h2 id="overview"><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>We are diving right into what is commonly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_choice">“Consumer Theory”</a> in textbooks. While our paradigmatic example will indeed be a consumer deciding what goods and services to purchase, please recognize that this model can be applied to just about <em>any</em> decision made by an individual. We should more appropriately describe it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">“Rational Choice Theory”</a>. This will take several classes to fully unpack as our formal model of <strong>constrained optimization</strong>, so today we are only focusing on the <em>constraints</em> using the tool known as the “budget constraint.”</p>
<p>While budget constraints are fairly straightforward, consumer theory often the most “alien” material to students of economics: preferences, indifference curves, and utility functions derived from behavioral axioms. The model we put together—constrained optimization—is borrowed from calculus and engineering. In my opinion, a good chunk of consumer theory, particularly about preferences (next class), is a waste of your time and will give you unnecessary anxiety. It’s perhaps neat for you to see how economists ground all of their models in utility-maximization, but our time is better spent on more productive things. If, however, you plan on going to graduate school for economics or social science, <strong>read this chapter, and my online appendices, in great detail.</strong><span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">And see <a href="https://twitter.com/graykimbrough/status/1291017699481575424">this tweet</a> for an 100% accurate example of what you can expect in a common Ph.D textbook discussing preferences.<br />

<p>Now that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings <em>before</em> each class.</p>
<p>If you are following the textbook, we are going a bit out of order in two ways. It ggoes straight into (a review of principles, really) supply &amp; demand in Chapters 1-3. We will ultimately get to supply and demand, but if you trust me, by the time we do later this semester, you will have a <em>much</em> richer understanding and appreciation for them, having understood <strong>how they represent the decisions by optimizing individuals as buyers and sellers.</strong></p>
<p>It begins “Consumer Theory” as chapter 4. It also stars with the “newer” and “weirder” stuff first — indifference curves and utility functions, and then teaches budget constraints second. I will go in the <em>opposite</em> order to slowly acclimate you from familiar territory (linear equations) into newer tools and concepts (nonlinear functions, multivariate functions, optimization, etc). This is also a good time to review my <a href="/files/math_review_guide.pdf">Math Review Guide</a> for next week.</p>
<p>The Bastiat reading is perhaps one of the greatest economic parables ever written, and demonstrates the importance of opportunity cost in clear thinking (especially about policy).</p>

<h3 id="budget-constraint-for-n-goods">Budget Constraint for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> Goods</h3>
<p>While we can derive a lot of useful propositions and testable claims using a simple model with just 2 goods, obviously there are many orders of magnitude more goods in an economy. Economics at the graduate and professional level begins with abstract models of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> number of goods in an economy. Naturally, we cannot graph this, so we must deal in abstract equations and set theory:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\}\)</span> denote the set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> goods in an economy. Let <span class="math inline">\(\{p_1,p_2, \cdots, p_n\}\)</span> denote the set of market prices affiliated with each good. Let <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> again denote an individual’s income.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> goods, the budget set is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + \cdots + p_n x_n \leq m\]</span></p>
<p>Which we can simplify, using <a href="https://metricsf20.classes.ryansafner.com/class/2.1-class/#the-summation-operator">summation notation</a>, as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i \leq m\]</span></p>
<p>To get the limit of this set, the budget constraint, make it an equality:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i = m\]</span>
As usual, this simply says that one’s total expenditures (on all goods) on the left-hand side, must be equal to one’s income on the right-hand side.</p>
