<h2 id="overview"><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>Solving a one-time constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the <em>dynamics</em> of change are far more interesting and useful: how do people optimally <em>respond</em> to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income.</p>
<p>An individual’s <strong>demand function</strong> (often just called <strong>“demand”</strong>) for a particular good describes how that person optimally responds to changes in market conditions. While in truth, many things factor into one’s demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person’s quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of <em>other</em> goods, and the person’s income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good’s price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar <strong>demand curve</strong> you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.</p>
<p>Today, we look only at how changes in <em>income</em> or changes in the prices of <em>other</em> goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.</p>
<p>In doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an <em>elasticity.</em> You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.</p>
<p>Today we will be working on <a href="/practice/1.6-practice">practice problems</a>. Answers will be posted later on that page.</p>
