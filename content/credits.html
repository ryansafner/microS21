<p>Nobody produces something like this without a lot of inspiration and guidance from those who have already done this before. Here, I try to give credit where it is due, and slowly begin to document how I made everything, for those who eventually want to do what I did.</p>
<p>This website is written in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>, built with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, pushed to <a href="https://github.com/ryansafner/lawS21">Github</a>, and hosted by <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>The inspiration for making individual course websites, along with the basic structure, comes from the incomparable <a href="https://andrewheiss.com">Andrew Heiss</a>. See his website for examples, as well as a number of helpful tutorials. Sadly, I had to figure out how these websites work on my own, and attempted to document my process in the README of <a href="https://github.com/ryansafner/classwebtest">this repository</a> for those interested. One day I may make a guide.</p>
<p>The course hex sticker I made via <a href="https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker">hexSticker</a>, and keep all of my course hex stickers in <a href="https://github.com/ryansafner/hexstickers">this repository</a>. This particular one uses images from <a href="https://thenounproject.com">The Noun Project</a>, and I produced it in the free online version of <a href="https://designer.gravit.io">Gravit designer</a> before running the hex sticker code.</p>
