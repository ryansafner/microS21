</span></span> to <strong>upload on Blackboard</strong> under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph &amp; convert them <strong>to a single PDF</strong>, if they are easily readable, but this is <em>not preferred</em>. See my <a href="/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments">guide to making a PDF</a> - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the <code>pdf</code> above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers).</p>
<p>For the few questions that ask you to draw a <strong>graph</strong>, <em>try</em> to do so <em>on your computer</em> (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph.</p>
<p>You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.</p>
<h2 id="concepts-and-critical-thinking">Concepts and Critical Thinking</h2>
<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>
<p>How can we use utility functions, which have actual numbers that can be measured and compared, to model preferences and still say with a straight face that preferences are subjective? Hint: what does it mean for a utility function to be <em>ordinal</em> or <em>cardinal</em>? Why can multiple utility functions describe the same preferences?</p>
<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>Describe, in your own words, what the <em>marginal rate of substitution</em> between two goods means. How is it different from the slope of the budget constraint?</p>
<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>
<p>Describe, in your own words, what happens at the optimum consumption point. Why is it the optimum? What does the equality of the slope of the indifference curve and the slope of the budget constraint <em>mean</em>, in English?</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>
<p>Juan enjoys both music and fireworks. His income is $240 per month. Music streaming costs $12 per month, and fireworks cost $8 per bag.</p>
<h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4>
<p>Graph the budget constraint Juan faces, with music on the vertical axis and fireworks on the horizontal axis.</p>
<h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4>
<p>If Juan spends all his income on music, how much music can he afford? Plot a point that illustrates this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="part-c">Part C</h4>
<p>If Juan spends all his income on fireworks, how many bags of reworks can he afford? Plot a point that illustrates this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="part-d">Part D</h4>
<p>If Juan spends half his income on fireworks and half his income on music, how much of each can he afford? Plot a point that illustrates this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="part-e">Part E</h4>
<p>Connect the dots to create Juan’s budget constraint. What is the slope of the budget constraint?</p>
<h4 id="part-f">Part F</h4>
<p>Suppose that a holiday bonus raises Juan’s income temporarily to $360. Draw Juan’s new budget constraint.</p>
<h4 id="part-g">Part G</h4>
<p>Now suppose that during the holiday, with his holiday bonus, the price of fireworks increases to $12 and the price of music increases to 18. If he spends all of his income on fireworks, how many can Juan buy? How about music? What happens to his budget constraint, and why?</p>

<h4 id="part-c-2">Part C</h4>
