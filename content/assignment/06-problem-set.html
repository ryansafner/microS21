<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>Show all work for calculations. You may lose points, even if correct, for missing work. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>
<p>Consider the following <em>Entry game</em> in normal form. Suppose there are two firms, each of whom can choose to Enter a market, or Stay Out. If both firms enter, they split the market, each earning $50. If both stay out, each firm earns $0. If one enters and the other stays out, the entrant can act as a monopolist and earns $100, with the other firm earning $0.</p>
<p><img src="https://micros21.classes.ryansafner.com/images/entrygame1.png" /></p>
<p>What is the Nash Equilibrium of this game?</p>
<h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>
<p>Suppose you are a restaurant in a <strong>monopolistically competitive</strong> industry. Your firm has a constant marginal and average cost at $4 per unit.</p>
<p><img src="/assignment/06-problem-set_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4>
<p>If this were a perfectly competitive market, what would be the market price and equilibrium quantity?</p>
<h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4>
<p>Calculate the (i) consumer surplus, (ii) profit, and (iii) deadweight loss at this price and quantity. Show these on the graph.</p>
<h4 id="part-c">Part C</h4>
<p>Now suppose this firm has market power from a barrier to entry, and can operate like a monopolist. What price and quantity does it set?</p>
<h4 id="part-d">Part D</h4>
<p>Calculate the (i) consumer surplus, (ii) profit, and (iii) deadweight loss at this price and quantity. Show these on the graph.</p>
<h4 id="part-e">Part E</h4>
<p>Now suppose that the firm had earned this market power via rent-seeking. From its lobbying efforts, it had convinced the local government to require all new restaurants to get a special license, making it harder for new entrants to compete in the market. What was the most that this firm was willing to spend on lobbying in order to get the license requirement?</p>
<h4 id="part-f">Part F</h4>
<p>If there are 10 identical (in terms of costs and size, if not food or brand) restaurants in the industry, and all engage in maximal rent-seeking to obtain the license, what is the true total cost of market power in this market to society?</p>
<h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>
<p>You are a producer of smartphones and have some market power. You have a cost structure:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
C(q)&amp;=10q^2+200q+1000\\
MC(q)&amp;=20q+200\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>You estimate the demand for your smartphones to be:
<span class="math display">\[q=100-0.2p\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is millions of smartphones.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-1">Part A</h4>
<p>Find the function for your marginal revenues.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-1">Part B</h4>
<p>How many smartphones should you produce, and at what price, to maximize your profit?</p>
<h4 id="part-c-1">Part C</h4>
<p>What is the cost per smartphone at the quantity you are producing?</p>
<h4 id="part-d-1">Part D</h4>
<p>What is your total profit?</p>
<h4 id="part-e-1">Part E</h4>
<p>What would be the lowest possible price you would need to charge to break even?</p>
<h4 id="part-f-1">Part F</h4>
<p>How much of your price is markup over marginal cost?</p>
<h4 id="part-g">Part G</h4>
<p>Calculate the elasticity of demand at your profit-maximizing price.</p>
<h3 id="question-9">Question 9</h3>
<p>Suppose that the market demand for bentonite is given by
<span class="math display">\[q = 40 - 0.5p\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> tons of bentonite per day and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the price per ton. Bentonite is produced by a monopolist at a constant marginal and average total cost of $10 per ton.</p>

<h3 id="question-10">Question 10</h3>
<p>Consider a boat rental firm on a popular beach that has a constant average and marginal cost of $30 per boat hire. It has estimated that demand from Locals <span class="math inline">\((L)\)</span> and demand from Tourists <span class="math inline">\((T)\)</span> are:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
q_L&amp;=40-0.4p\\
q_T&amp;=25-0.1p\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<h4 id="part-a-3">Part A</h4>
<h5 id="suppose-it-must-charge-a-single-price-to-all-customers.-find-the-profit-maximizing-quantity-price-and-the-total-profits.">Suppose it must charge a single price to all customers. Find the profit-maximizing quantity, price, and the total profits.</h5>
<h4 id="part-b-3">Part B</h4>
<p>How much of the price is markup?</p>
<h4 id="part-c-3">Part C</h4>
<p>What is the price elasticity of demand at this price?</p>
<h4 id="part-d-3">Part D</h4>
<p>Now suppose the firm is able to segment the market and charge different prices to Tourists and Locals. Find the profit-maximizing quantity, price, and the total profits.</p>
<h4 id="part-e-3">Part E</h4>
<p>For each segment of the market: how much of the price is markup, and what is the price elasticity of demand at the optimal price? How did the price for each segment change from the single price (Part A), and why?</p>
<h3 id="question-11">Question 11</h3>
<p>Malwart is a large retail chain that has opened in a small town. With few other job opportunities for low-skilled workers, it has monopsony power in the local labor market for low-skilled workers. Its marginal revenue product of labor is
<span class="math display">\[MRP_L=80-0.8L\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the total number of workers. The labor supply curve of local low-skilled workers is
<span class="math display">\[w=0.4L+8\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the yearly wage (in $1,000’s per worker).</p>
<h4 id="part-a-4">Part A</h4>
<p>Write a function for the marginal cost of labor.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-4">Part B</h4>
<p>What quantity of workers will the firm hire, and what wage will it pay its workers?</p>
<h4 id="part-c-4">Part C</h4>
<p>What would the quantity of workers be, and what would the wage be, if the labor market was perfectly competitive?</p>
<h4 id="part-d-4">Part D</h4>
<p>Calculate the price elasticity of labor supply at the monoposony wage from part C.</p>
<h4 id="part-e-4">Part E</h4>
<p>Now suppose a new commuter rail service allows workers to cheaply commute to nearby towns to work, making the labor supply curve instead:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[w=0.2L+20\]</span></p>
<p>What quantity of workers will the firm hire, and what wage will it pay its workers?<span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Hint: first find the new <span class="math inline">\(MC(L)\)</span> equation.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h4 id="part-f-2">Part F</h4>
<p>Calculate the price elasticity of labor supply at the monoposony wage from Part E.</p>
<h4 id="part-g-1">Part G</h4>
<p>Compare your answers to Parts C &amp; D to Parts E &amp; F. How is market power (and inefficiency) related to price elasticity?</p>
