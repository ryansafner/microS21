<p><strong>Exam 2 will be available 8:00 AM <em>Monday, April 4 through 10:00 PM Sunday April 11</em> on Blackboard</strong><span><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Go to our class Blackboard page, on the blue navigation bar on the left, click <em>Assignments</em>, you will find Exam 2.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>This applies to both sections. Note for obvious reasons, exams are different exams across sections.</p>
<p>If you have any approved testing accommodations, please let me know ASAP and we will make arrangements. Given the time you have to complete the exam, I will not look favorably on excuses given on Sunday.</p>
<p>While the exam is out, I will not answer any questions related to 1.1-1.8 content at Office Hours, by email, or Slack. We can, of course, still discuss other things. If you have questions, please discuss them with me before Monday (Sept 14) night.</p>

<p>This test will be available on Blackboard as a <em>timed</em> assignment. You will have <strong>2 hours once you open the test on Blackboard</strong>. You will <em>not</em> need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the technical difficulties of taking an exam at home. <strong>Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours</strong>. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but <em>the timer will continue to run</em> once the exam is first opened.</p>
<p>You must show all of your work (for calculation problems), either by typing your steps into the answer form, or you may upload (or as a <em>last</em> resort (please!), email me them before your time runs out), handwritten steps to the exam, solving your problems.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>open note, open book</strong> exam, but <strong>do not use the internet beyond our class website, or contact each other</strong><span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Google won’t help you here. Everything you need should be in your notes, homeworks, or slides anyway!<br />
<br />
</span></span> I will automatically interpret substantially-similarly-written answers, obviously-googled answers, and messaging between students as cheating or plagiarism, respectively. Either will earn you a 0, and be reported. Answers should be <em>in your own words</em>, I will also deduct points for blatant copy-pastes off my slides (those are <em>my</em> words, not yours!).</p>

<p>Above, you have a previous semester’s exam 2. Use it to get a sense of what questions are asked, the format, and how many. Questions draw from topics in Unit 2, and note that <strong>just because topics or questions were not in the practice exam does NOT mean they may not show up on your exam.</strong><span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I hope that this is obvious. I write this to ensure there is no misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Aside from minor extensions, no mathematical problem on any exam should be something you have not seen in some form before.</p>
<p>I will post the <strong>answer key</strong> on <strong>Friday October 9</strong>. I am happy to discuss other individual answers and strategies during Office Hours.</p>
<h2 id="my-advice">My Advice</h2>
<p>Make sure you do all of the homework problems and learn from the answer keys to the homeworks, as well as the in-class practice problems. All of the math problems are largely in the style of the homework questions. While some of the questions should be novel applications, conceptual questions on homeworks will get you in the right headspace to think about answering a question on an exam.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The point of exams is to <em>apply</em> what you’ve learned, not to literally regurgitate it! Or, at least, it should be.<br />
