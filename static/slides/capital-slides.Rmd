# What is Capital?

.pull-left[

- A note on how we used capital $K$ earlier this semester...

- Assumed capital (essentially machines) has a market price $“r”$, the “rental rate of capital”
  - Most firms purchase machines outright, rather than rent them per period (e.g. per hour)
  - But like any input, we consider the (opportunity) cost of using a marginal unit of an input as its market price if it were exchanged on the market
  - Hence, consider the price of capital the market rate to rent a machine for an hour

- Some generally observed features of capital:

- .hi-turquoise[Capital is *not an original factor*]
  - It’s land & labor combined in the past (i.e. someone had to make the shovel, the factory, etc. with land & labor)

- .hi-turquoise[Capital goods are not directly consumed]
  - Used in the production of other goods

- .hi-turquoise[Capital inherently consists of a time element]
  - Makes labor more productive
  - Capital as “stored labor time”
  - Capital comes from **savings**, and earns **interest**

- For our purposes today, let’s not think of capital as *physical* capital, but as financial capital

# Rule of 72

- A good rule of thumb: number of years for your principal to double:

$$\frac{72}{r}$$
- This is known as the .hi-purple[rule of 72]<sup>.magenta[1]</sup>

.footnote[<sup>.magenta[1]</sup> Different people use other numbers, like 70. The point is more to make mental calculations easily rather than accurately.]

# Rule of 72

.hi-green[Example]:

- If interest rate is 2%, your money doubles in $\frac{72}{2}=36$ years

--

- If interest rate is 3%, your money doubles in $\frac{72}{3}=24$ years

--

- If interest rate is 4%, your money doubles in $\frac{72}{4}=18$ years

--

- If interest rate is 6%, your money doubles in $\frac{72}{6}=12$ years

- Interest rate is very important price! Makes all the difference whether it is 1% vs. 2%!

- Again, consider the “life cycle” of decisions

- People like to “smooth” their consumption over time, rather than experience sudden, discontinuous jumps in consumption level
  - When actual income $<$ preferred consumption: **borrow** money
  - When actual income $>$ preferred consumption: **save** (and lend) money
