  1. They are .hi-purple[Competitive]: many buyers and many sellers
  2. They each .hi-purple[equilibrium] (.hi-purple[prices are free to adjust]): absence of transactions costs or policies *preventing prices from adjusting* to meet supply and demand
  3. .hi-purple[There are no externalities] are present: costs and benefits are fully internalized by the parties to transactions 

- If any of these conditions are not met, we have .hi[market failure]

# One Possibility: Inelastic Supply

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- It might that .red[supply] is very *inelastic*
  - Here: *perfectly* inelastic (for convenience)

- Suppliers can’t produce and sell more units even if they want to at very high price demanded
  - sudden shock to inventories (short run)
  - rising production costs
  - government regulations &amp; restrictions

- Thus, the new high price is an equilibrium that will persist for a while
  - no “inefficiency,” just a fixed supply of goods we cannot easily change

"Also being reexamined are state certificate-of-need, or CON, laws. A product of 1970s-era economic regulation, CON laws require health-care providers to prove that new services are “needed” before they may purchase certain large equipment, open new or expanded facilities, or—as is crucial now—offer home health-care services. Often, these laws give an effective veto power to existing medical providers, allowing them to torpedo new competition for their own benefit...Basic economics predicts that competition reduces prices for consumers, and occupational licensing works directly to stifle competition."
