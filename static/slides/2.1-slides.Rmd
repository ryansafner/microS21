# Producer Behavior

.pull-left[

- How do **producers** decide:
    - which products to produce
    - in what quantity
    - using which resources
    - and for what price? 

- Answers to these questions are building blocks for **supply curves**

- So what do firms do? 

1. **Choose:** .hi-blue[ < some alternative >]

2. **In order to maximize:** .hi-green[< profits >]

3. **Subject to:** .hi-red[< technology >]

- We've so far assumed they maximize profits and they are limited by their technology

# The Firm's Optimization Problem II

.pull-left[
- What do firms **choose**? (Not an easy answer)

- Prices?
    - Depends on the market the firm is operating in!
    - Study of <span class="hi">industrial organization</span>
    
- Essential question: how competitive is a market? This will influence what firms (can) do

# Industrial Organization: A Roadmap I

.pull-left[

- Begin with one extreme case: .hi["perfect competition"]
  - Firms can choose to sell as much $q^*$ as they want
  - Firms are constrained to sell at the (exogenous) market price $\bar{p}$

- Appropriate for settings with *many* firms, each small relative to market

# Interlude

.pull-left[

- After we find firm's **optimal decisions** in this market (and have Exam 2), we will then finally look at **market equilibrium**

- Put Supply and Demand together

# Interlude

.pull-left[

- We've seen how **consumers** cause and respond to market changes
  - e.g. $(\Delta p_x$, $\Delta p_y$, $\Delta m$)
  
- We're about to explore how **producers** cause and respond to market changes

- Finally we can explain all of these market changes with Supply and Demand .hi[equilibrium models]

- Discuss how markets work, why they are good & efficient, and when they fail

# Industrial Organization: A Roadmap II

.pull-left[
- Examine another extreme case: .hi[monopoly] of a single seller
    - Appropriate for some markets

- .hi-purple["Imperfect competition"]: models of .hi[monopolistic competition] & .hi[oligopoly]
    - In latter case, firms act **strategically**, so we will need <span class="hi-purple">game theory</span>
    
- Firms can choose *both* $q^*$ & $p^*$ to maximize $\pi$
