- Labor is considered a .hi[disutility] (a .hi[bad])
  - **Opportunity cost** of labor is .hi[leisure]

- It depends!

- Leisure is a normal good, but this makes labor “inferior”
$$H = 24 -\ell$$
  - $\uparrow \ell \implies \downarrow H$

- This is why .hi-purple[income and substitution effects] are important! (remember [all that stuff](/content/1.6-content)? 😰)

# Marginal Revenue Product (of Labor)

- Hiring more labor increases new output (i.e. labor's .hi-purple[`\\(MP_L\\)`])
  - [Recall](/content/2.2-content/): $MP_L=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}$, where $q$ is units of output

--

- Additional output generates new revenues (i.e. labor's .hi-purple[`\\(MR(q)\\)`])
  - Recall: $MR(q)=\frac{\Delta R(q)}{\Delta q}$, where $R(q)$ is total revenue
--

- Hiring more labor, on the **margin**, generates a **benefit**, called the .hi[marginal revenue product of labor, `\\(MRP_L\\)`]:
$$MRP_L=MP_L* MR(q)$$
  - i.e. the number of new products a new worker makes times the revenue earned by selling the new products

# Example

.green[**Example**]: Victoria’s Tours is a travel company that offers guided tours of nearby mountain biking trails. Its marginal revenue product of labor is given by $MRP_L = 1,000 – 40l$, where $l$ is the number of tour-guide weeks it hires and $MRP_L$ is measured in dollars per tour-guide week. The going market wage for Victoria’s Tours is $600 per tour-guide week.

]

1. What is the optimal amount of labor for Victoria’s Tours to hire?

2. At and above what market wage would Victoria’s Tours not want to hire anyone?

3. What is the most labor Victoria’s Tours would ever hire, given its marginal revenue product?
