# What is Capital?

.pull-left[

- A note on how we used capital `\(K\)` earlier this semester...

- Assumed capital (essentially machines) has a market price `\(“r”\)`, the “rental rate of capital”
  - Most firms purchase machines outright, rather than rent them per period (e.g. per hour)
  - But like any input, we consider the (opportunity) cost of using a marginal unit of an input as its market price if it were exchanged on the market
  - Hence, consider the price of capital the market rate to rent a machine for an hour

# What is Capital?

- Exact nature &amp; definition remains controversial to economists to this day

  - hard to define or (especially) aggregate
  - necessarily bound up with time and uncertainty

- Economists (and others) often talk about different *types* of capital
  - .hi-turquoise[Physical capital]: tools, machines, specialized equipment, software, that makes labor more productive
  - .hi-turquoise[Human capital]: skills, training, education, experience embodied in a person that makes their labor more productive
  - .hi-turquoise[Financial capital]: access to immediate cash to finance investment for production

- Social scientists also talk about “political capital,” “social capital,” etc...

- Some generally observed features of capital:

- .hi-turquoise[Capital is *not an original factor*]
  - It’s land &amp; labor combined in the past (i.e. someone had to make the shovel, the factory, etc. with land &amp; labor)

- .hi-turquoise[Capital goods are not directly consumed]
  - Used in the production of other goods

- .hi-turquoise[Capital inherently consists of a time element]
  - Makes labor more productive
  - Capital as “stored labor time”
  - Capital comes from **savings**, and earns **interest**

- For our purposes today, let’s not think of capital as *physical* capital, but as financial capital
  - All types of capital have the following financial aspect

- Capital is about .hi-purple[the diversion of present consumption towards future consumption]
  - Capital comes from savings, and is used for investments that firms (and households) use to increase their (production for) consumption
  - The return that owners of capital get for providing capital to firms is .hi[interest]

- During harvest time, can consume all produce today, or save some for next year
  - The more you save today, the less you can eat now, but the more you will have in the future

# Rule of 72

.hi-green[Example]:

- If interest rate is 2%, your money doubles in `\(\frac{72}{2}=36\)` years

--

- If interest rate is 3%, your money doubles in `\(\frac{72}{3}=24\)` years

--

- If interest rate is 4%, your money doubles in `\(\frac{72}{4}=18\)` years

--

- If interest rate is 6%, your money doubles in `\(\frac{72}{6}=12\)` years

- Interest rate is very important price! Makes all the difference whether it is 1% vs. 2%!
